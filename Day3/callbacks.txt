Callbacks:
>> A callback is a function that runs automatically when a user interacts with a widget.
instead of,
>> checking buttons again and again
>> writing logic everywhere
>> Just you attach logic to an event

Why callbacks exist?
>> Rerun top to bottom
>> Every script restarts the script 
>> without callbacks logic becomes messy
