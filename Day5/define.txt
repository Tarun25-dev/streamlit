Form:
>> A form groups multiple inputs and waits for a submit button before processing.

Why Forms?
>> Beacuse normally in streamlit,
   >> Every input change --> app reruns
   >> Every button click --> app reruns immediately
>> But in real applications:
>> User fills everything → clicks Submit → THEN processing happens.

>> In streamlit we can define form in st.form()

What happens Without Form?

name = st.text_input("Name")
age = st.number_input("Age")

if st.button("Submit"):
    st.write("Submitted")

# here every input that we enter into that input it takes and reruns the total script, thats the problem.

What happens when use forms?

with st.form("my_form"):
    name = st.text_input("Name")
    age = st.number_input("Age")
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")

if submitted:
    st.write("Name:", name)
    st.write("Age:", age)

"st.form_submit_button() is used to submit all the inputs together at once.
>> we must use inside of the form only
